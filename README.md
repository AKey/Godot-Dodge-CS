# Dodge The Creeps
## A Godot project in C#

A small [Godot](http://godotengine.org) game from the Godot docs first game project [lesson](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html) utilizing Visual Studio Code and the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7 and the C# language.
**NOTICE**: As of Godot 3.2.2 you can *not* use .NET Framework 4.7.2 or anything other than [4.7 Developer Pack](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)

This project is intented to test that I have installed and am using all packages and plugins required to complete more complex Godot projects using C#
